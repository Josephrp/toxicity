# The Toxicity Dataset
*by [Surge AI](https://www.surgehq.ai)*

Saving the internet is fun. Combing through thousands of online comments to build a toxicity dataset isn't. That's why we created The Toxicity Dataset — so you can skip the slog and get to work.  

We hope you find this dataset useful, whether you want to flag hate speech, build content moderation tools, or simply learn how your users express themselves.

Need a larger or targeted dataset of toxicity, or toxicity in other languages (Spanish, French, German, Japanese, Portuguese, and 17+ more)? Post an issue or reach out to team@surgehq.ai!

## Dataset
This repo contains 500 toxic and 500 non-toxic comments from a variety of popular social media platforms. 

## Columns
* `text`: the text of the comment
* `is_toxic`: whether or not the comment is toxic 

## Future
We'll be adding more languages and annotations (e.g., augmenting each comment with a severity ranking, adding categories, etc) over time.
